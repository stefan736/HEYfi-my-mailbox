# HEYfi my mailbox 

[HEY.com](https://hey.com) is a brilliant mail service made by [basecamp](https://basecamp.com). 
By introducing some key elements and processes it makes working with mails nice again. 

Unfortunately it does not support using own domains, so I would like to apply some of the ideas to my mailbox. 

## (some) Key Elements

### Screener

You decide which mail can reach you, by categorizing every sender as screened positiv or negative. 


### Imbox

Only mails from positively screened senders are a going to in. 

### Reply Later

From the Imbox you can decide to read a mail later and move it out of your focus temporarily. 

### Set aside

Mails you want to access frequently or more directly without much searching you can set aside. 


### Paper Trail

Receipts, orders, invoices are collected in a paper trail. 

### The Feed

All newsletters & marketing mails you screened positive are going into the feed to read later like a newsfeed or timeline on social media.
